### Welcome!
This is the lab wiki. For more info about our team, research, blog, and publications see [magdalenasabat.github.io/](https://magdalenasabat.github.io/)

This wiki is mostly inspired by [Anne Urai's lab wiki ](https://anne-urai.github.io/lab_wiki/) in turn is inspired by similar documents from [Mariam Aly](https://osf.io/mdh87/wiki/home/), [Trina MacMahon](https://d1uqjtzsuwlnsf.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/163/2016/11/McMahon_UW_Compact_Example.pdf), [Bray Voytek](https://voyteklab.com/philosophy) and [Michael Beyer](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y1wzFVdp-FCoGM47okaW5eYdOOfpgXD5nM9Q7DpwAMo/edit).

### Interested in collaborating? Looking for a bachelor's or master's internship?

I'm affiliated with LNC and LSP at the Cognitive Science Department at Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris, France. If you're affiliated with a university in France and are looking for an L3, M1, or M2 internship please check out [proposals already posted on the department's website](https://cogmaster.ens.psl.eu/en/program/internships-14261) - these projects have guaranteed funding. If you're from outside France or you would like to propose a new project or explore some of [my ideas](https://magdalenasabat.github.io/lab_wiki/ProjectIdeas.html), we would need to work together on providing funding for the internship. 

Before you apply, [please make sure our work styles and work vision in general are aligned](https://magdalenasabat.github.io/wiki/Vision.html) and get acquainted with my favorite work tools.

- [our values](https://anne-urai.github.io/lab_wiki/Vision.html), including some expectation management.
- [project ideas](https://anne-urai.github.io/lab_wiki/ProjectIdeas.html).

Once you've gone through those and have tried the exercises, let me know how things went (and where/if you got stuck) and what research questions you'd like to pursue.
